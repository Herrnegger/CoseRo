\usage{
get_zones_for_subbasins(
  cosero_path,
  subbasins = "all",
  defaults_settings = NULL,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cosero_path}{COSERO project path}

\item{subbasins}{Subbasin IDs (character or numeric), or "all" for all subbasins}

\item{defaults_settings}{Optional list of COSERO settings passed by the
optimizer. If it contains \code{PARAFILE}, that filename takes precedence
over what is currently in defaults.txt (since defaults.txt is only updated
later by \code{run_cosero()}). If NULL, the filename is read from
defaults.txt, falling back to "para.txt".}

\item{quiet}{Suppress messages}
}
\value{
List with zones (integer vector) and subbasins (character vector)
}
\description{
Returns zone IDs belonging to specified subbasins by reading the NB_ and NZ_
columns from the parameter file (e.g., para.txt). The parameter filename is
determined from defaults.txt (PARAFILE entry). If \code{defaults_settings}
contains a \code{PARAFILE} override, that takes precedence because
defaults.txt has not yet been updated at the time this function is called
during optimization setup.
