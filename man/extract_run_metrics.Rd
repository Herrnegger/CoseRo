\title{Extract Pre-calculated Metrics from Single COSERO Run}
\usage{
extract_run_metrics(run_result, subbasin_id = "001", metric = "NSE")
}
\arguments{
\item{run_result}{Result object from run_cosero()}

\item{subbasin_id}{Subbasin ID to extract metrics for (e.g., "001" or 1).
Use "all" to extract metrics for all subbasins.}

\item{metric}{Performance metric to extract ("NSE", "KGE", "BIAS", "RMSE", etc.)
Must be a column name in the statistics data frame}
}
\value{
If subbasin_id is specified: Single numeric value for that subbasin
If subbasin_id = "all": Named vector with metrics for all subbasins
}
\description{
Extracts performance metrics (NSE, KGE, etc.) from a single COSERO run's
statistics output. This is the recommended approach for standard metrics
as it uses COSERO's pre-calculated values.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Run COSERO
result <- run_cosero("path/to/project")

# Extract NSE for subbasin 001
nse <- extract_run_metrics(result, subbasin_id = "001", metric = "NSE")

# Extract KGE for all subbasins
kge_all <- extract_run_metrics(result, subbasin_id = "all", metric = "KGE")
}
