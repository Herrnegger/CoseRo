\title{WINFORE ET0 Data Preprocessing for COSERO}
\description{
High-performance extraction of WINFORE gridded potential evapotranspiration
(ET0) data for Austrian hydrological zones. Uses the same sparse weight
matrix approach as the SPARTACUS preprocessing functions
(\code{\link{write_spartacus_precip}}, \code{\link{write_spartacus_temp}}).

WINFORE v2.1 provides daily reference (potential) evapotranspiration on the
same 1 km Lambert Conformal Conic grid as SPARTACUS. The NetCDF files store
data with vertically flipped rows (south at top), so a vertical flip is
applied during processing.
}
\details{
The weight matrix is built once from the model zones and then reused for all
files. Each yearly file is read with \pkg{ncdf4}, the relevant cells are
extracted, and zonal means are computed via a single sparse matrix
multiplication \code{W \%*\% cell_values}. This is ~10x faster than
traditional polygon-based extraction.

Unlike SPARTACUS precipitation, \strong{no temporal shift} is applied because ET0
is a standard daily total (00:00-00:00 CET).

\strong{Missing Data:} If the NetCDF contains days with no valid data (all NA),
these are filled by carrying forward the last valid day's values. A warning
is issued listing the affected dates.
